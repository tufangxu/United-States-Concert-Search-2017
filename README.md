# INFO 201 AB Final Project

Produced by Zegang Cheng, Nathan Magdalera, Tufang Xu, and Shelley Tsui, this Shiny App utilizes the Jambase API
in order to create an interactive map that displays the locations of an artist/band based on user input. Users can click on individual map
markers to learn more information about the venue's location.
