#### This Shiny App utilizes the Jambase API in order to create an interactive map. The map displays the locations of an artist/band/concert information based on user input. Users can click on individual map markers to learn more information about the concert venue's location and date.

### Other information...
### If an artist does not exist within the dataset or does not have a concert, then the map will reset back to a default state.
