#### This Shiny App utilizes the Jambase API in order to create an interactive map. The map displays the locations of an artist/band/concert information based on user input. Users can click on individual map markers to learn more information about the concert venue's location and date. This app is meant for people who want to find out about venue locations of their desired artist in a fairly easy manner.

### Other information...
### If an artist does not exist within the dataset or does not have a concert, then the map will reset back to a default state.
