This application was designed by Zegang Cheng, Tufang Xu,
Nathan Magdalera, and Shelley Tsui as a final project for
the INFO 201 class at the University of Washington. Our intention was to allow music lovers to search for current/future events by different artists based on location.

Concert information was acquired from JamBase's API.
